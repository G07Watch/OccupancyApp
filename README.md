Occupancy App


Background and Overview

  The primary purpose of this application is meant to be part of a multi-pronged approach to prolonged social distancing efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  The Occupancy App's primary goal is to allow a business or organization to communicate, in real-time, the number of people in a given facility.  A secondary function intended to be implemented is the assignment of time slots for visitors/faculty and the ability to reserve slots using a time- span determined by the coordinators of the facility.
